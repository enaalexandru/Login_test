This is a concise overview of an automation test flow utilizing the Page Object Model (POM) approach for a website:

"This automation positive test flow utilizes the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to streamline the testing process for a website. It begins by instantiating the necessary page objects, such as the login page and products page, and performing login actions. Assertions are made to verify the correctness of the page elements and navigation. Additionally, interactions with various elements, such as adding items to the cart and proceeding through the checkout process, are automated. Assertions are used throughout the test flow to ensure the expected behavior of the website. Finally, the test concludes by verifying the completion of an order and returning to the homepage."


"This automation negative test flow employs the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to facilitate testing of a website. The test begins by navigating to the login page and entering invalid credentials. Using explicit waits, interactions such as entering text and clicking buttons are synchronized with the page loading. Assertions are utilized to verify the correctness of the page URL and the presence of error messages. This approach encapsulates page-specific elements and actions within dedicated page classes, promoting code reusability and maintainability."


Utilizing the Page Object Model elevates code maintainability, readability, and reusability, offering a structured framework for automated testing across different sections of the website.
